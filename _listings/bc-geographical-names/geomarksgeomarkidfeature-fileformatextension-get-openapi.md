  title: Geo Mark Web Service Get the feature and attribution of the geomark
  description: The geomark feature resource returns a single spatial feature with
    either a single (Point, LineString, Polygon) or multi-part geometry (MultiPoint,
    MultiLineString, MultiPolygon) and the geomark attribution.  The geometry and
    attribution can be downloaded as a spatial download file format in a supported
    coordinate system. The download files can then be used in a desktop GIS application
    (e.g. ArcMap), Google Earth or a web mapping application.
