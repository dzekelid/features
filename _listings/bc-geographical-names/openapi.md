      summary: Get the feature and attribution of the geomark
      description: The geomark feature resource returns a single spatial feature with
        either a single (Point, LineString, Polygon) or multi-part geometry (MultiPoint,
        MultiLineString, MultiPolygon) and the geomark attribution.  The geometry
        and attribution can be downloaded as a spatial download file format in a supported
        coordinate system. The download files can then be used in a desktop GIS application
        (e.g. ArcMap), Google Earth or a web mapping application.
